# Hi there, I'm Deepak 👋

**Data Scientist & AI Engineer** building intelligent systems that bridge the gap between research and production.

## 🚀 What I Do

I specialize in **end-to-end AI solutions** - from data preprocessing to production deployment. My work spans across multiple domains where I combine traditional machine learning with cutting-edge generative AI to solve real-world problems.

### 🎯 Core Expertise
- **Machine Learning Operations**: Model deployment, monitoring, A/B testing, and automated retraining pipelines
- **Generative AI**: Fine-tuning foundation models, prompt engineering, and custom content generation systems  
- **Natural Language Processing**: Text analysis, sentiment detection, information extraction, and conversational AI
- **Computer Vision**: Object detection, image classification, quality control systems, and multimodal analysis
- **Full-Stack Development**: Building complete AI applications with React frontends, FastAPI backends, and Docker deployments
